# Express React router
*Middleware for Express that Servers React Router Websites*

Creates a middleware router for [express.js](http://expressjs.com) that will render a [react-router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router) website on the server.
Also includes a new react render function for the client side, that helps with creating isomorphic websites (uses same route on client and server).

### Features
* Render a react-router route on both the client and the server
* Add other express middleware/router/static files directly to the react-router route
* Use the same react-router route (w/ express routes) on both the client and server

### Usage
*TODO: add basic usage to README*

### Documentation
Basic usage is given above. More detailed documentation is before class/function definitions within the code.

### Example
*TODO: create example*

### Plans
* Add option client to turn on react's touch events
* Add option client to show a loading placeholder on slow react-router transitions
* Create working example, that new project can start from
* Create flowtype definitions for public API
* Get documentation from code
